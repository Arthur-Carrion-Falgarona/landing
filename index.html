      <h2>What is Formula One?</h2>
      <p>Formula 1 is the Holy Grail of motorsports, the pinnacle of speed, skill and glamor. Now, you might have heard that Formula 1 “is just cars going round in a circle”, but let me tell you what you are missing out if you believe in this profanity. </p>

      <p>To begin with, what is Formula 1? It is a championship of more than 20 races raced in a calendar year to know who the best pilot on earth is. F1 is contested by the 20 most skilled drivers and top 10 car manufacturers in the world. From speeds up to 370km/h, to G-Forces that only fighter pilots can relate to, as well as impressive crashes that you thought you could only see in video games, F1 is just about pushing the limits of speed, science and nerves.</p>

      <p>To continue, on race day, the five lights go out to indicate the start of the race, and the drivers muscle their cars around the track as fast as possible to reach the checkered flag and the finish line first. During a race, you will see breathtaking overtakes, breathtaking pit stops and breathtaking celebrations on the podiums, all of this while you are comfortably watching it from your couch at home. So you don’t have to make any effort to watch it! You will spectate supernatural battles between the drivers, and very original strategies established by the teams that usually surprises everyone.</p>

      <p>F1 is also about the fan experience. From the most iconic race tracks such as Silverstone in England, to the narrow streets of Las Vegas, Singapore and Monaco, Formula 1 travels everywhere in the world to live up to the international expectations of sports.</p>

      <p>Finally, since its birth in 1950, F1 has left a major impact on car innovation. Today, having developed the most efficient hybrid engines, F1 is at the forefront of tomorrow’s motoring technology. On track, it’s produced larger than life legends, heroes, and rivalries that have shaped decades. Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsports because it never stops changing and improving, all in search of an extra fraction of a second on track. There is really nothing like it.</p>
